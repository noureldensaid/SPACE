## Registration

The registration process in our application presents the user with a sign-up screen where they are prompted to provide their username, email, phone number, password, and confirm password. After signing up, the user has the option to tap "Already have an account" to proceed. The system then authenticates the user's data from the database. Once verified, the user is signed in and directed to the home page. The home page prominently displays a location permission prompt, which enables our application to access the user's location.

## Home & Explore Workspaces

The home page showcases featured workspaces, allowing users to click on a workspace to view its details. Users can add workspaces to their favorites, rate them, and report any problems. Additionally, the explore icon leads users to the explore screen, which displays all workspaces, popular workspaces, and nearby workspaces for the user.

Our application requests permission to access the user's location. Once granted, users can view workspaces on Google Maps and determine the distance between themselves and the workspaces. This feature assists users in selecting the nearest workspaces and easily finding their locations.

Users can select a suitable room from a workspace's available rooms. Clicking on a specific room opens the room details screen. Users can then choose a date by clicking on the "Select Date" button, specify the check-in and check-out time, and proceed to book by clicking on the "Checkout" button.
